        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello, my name is Eugene Park, I go to the University of California, Riverside, and I like to play video games. I especially like FPS (First-Person Shooting) games, and I love to eat. Recently, I got COVID-19 and it was not fun. Thankfully, I recovered but I am still not able to smell or taste. I know this may sound weird but I like to tickle feet. I like to see my friends laugh when they get tickled. I also like to collect shoes. Especially Jordan 1's, those are really nice pairs of shoes. I did track during my high school years. Sometimes I would run competitively, but I mostly do high jumps. I would consider myself really athletic because I can jump really far and high. For fun, I like to go to Japan and enjoy their food. I love the culture in Japan and I love watching the scenery around Japan. With all seriousness, I like to resell products and earn money. I am concentrating on Marketing because I feel the most confident in that area. When I want to earn quick cash, I like to go thrifting and resell whatever I find. And with that money, I like to go shopping for myself. If I feel generous, I would spend some of that money on my family. I have one huge tattoo on my left arm. I have a koi fish because I love Japan that much. I would like to get more tattoos on my body; however, getting tattoos is very expensive. I have four piercings in total: two on both of my ears. I have a pet dog named Tobi. He is around six years old and he is really adorable. I like to spend some of my free time playing with him. But compared to him, I do not have that much energy so I burn out very quickly. Fun fact, I get a lot of compliments about my eyes. A lot of girls say that I have pretty eyes; however, for some reason, I am not able to get a girl. I also did boy scouts. One of my biggest flex is telling people that I am Eagle Palm Silver. I use that to show off because only 0.1 percent of the population gets it every year. It is one of the hardest promotions to ever reach when you are in boy scouts. I know this may not sound very convincing, but I do go to church. As a kid, my parents would always drag me to church even if it is against my will. But now, I still go to church because it is fun to hang around with my friends that I am not able to meet every day at school. I currently joined a club at the University of California, Riverside, called KCM, Kristos Campus Mission. From what I have experienced. I believe KCM is really fun and I hope that I get to do many great things at that club.<br><br>
